What is Object-oriented Programing?
    - programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects"
    - the goal is to create an organized structure in our code that mirrors the real world

Key concepts
    - Objects: an instance of a class; represent real world entities
    - Classes: blueprint or template that defines the structure and behaviour of objects
    - Methods/Functions: defined within a class to perform operations on the objects data
    - Constructors: Method that is called when a class is created; is used to initialize an object state
    - Inheritance: mechanism in which one class and inherit methods and properties from another class
    - Encapsulation: the concept of bundling data and methods within a class and controlling access to that
                     data though public and private access modifiers
    - Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different data types and classes
    - Abstraction: the concept of hiding complex reality while exposing only the essential parts.
                   Simplifies complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts

What are the fundamental principles of OOP?
    - FOUR FUNDAMENTALS: ENCAPSULATION, POLYMORPHISM, INHERITANCE, ABSTRACTION

OOP languages include python, java, javascript, php, typescript, and much more




Access Modifiers

In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to define the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, variables,
and constructors within a program.

There are four different types of modifiers:


Public - Members declared as public are accessible from any class. They have the widest scope and can be
             accessed from any class or package.
Protected - Members declared as protected are accessible within the same package and by subclasses
             outside the package.
Private - Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class. They are not visible to any
        other class, even subclasses.
Default - if you do not specify an access modifier, it defaults to package-private. Members with default access
        are accessible only within the same package.


What does static mean?

    static is a keyword in Java used to create variables and methods that belong to the class itself,
    rather than to instances of the class


What is void?

    void is a keyword used in Java to declare that a method does not return any value. When a method has a return type
    of void, it means the method performs a task but does not produce a result that can be used in expressions.
    void methods are often used for actions or operations that do not need to return a value.
