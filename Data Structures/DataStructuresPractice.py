# Data structures

# Lists

# Sets - a list of unique values

# result is list will look like 1,2,3,4,4 and set will still be 1,2,3,4

# Stacks - data struct that foillows LIFA (Last In First Out)
# Queues - data struct that follows FIFO (First In First Out)
# Nodes - data struct that links data to more data
#       - It is a fundamental data structure used to store and represent data within these structures
# Linked list - data struct that stores multiple nodes
# Trees - hierarchical stat struc cisisting of nodes connected by edges (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, heaps)
#       - essentially multiple linked lists
